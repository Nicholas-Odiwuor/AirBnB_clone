# Airbnb Clone Project

## Description
This project is an Airbnb clone, which is a command-line interface for managing Airbnb objects. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete various objects such as users, states, cities, and places, mimicking the functionalities of the Airbnb platform.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter serves as the interface for interacting with the Airbnb objects through the command line. It provides a set of commands to perform operations like creating new objects, retrieving existing objects, updating attributes, and deleting objects.

### How to Start It
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:
1. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AirBnB_clone`
3. Run the console: `./console.py`

### How to Use It
Once the console is running, you can use the following commands:
- `create`: Create a new object.
- `show`: Show details of a specific object.
- `update`: Update attributes of an object.
- `destroy`: Delete an object.
- `all`: List all objects of a certain type.
- `quit`: Exit the console.

### Examples

- To update the name of a user: `update User <user_id> name "New Name"`
- To delete a user: `destroy User <user_id>`
